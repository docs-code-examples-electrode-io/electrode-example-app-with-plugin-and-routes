# Electrode Example App [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> Electrode example application

## Build With Us
This Electrode example app is created by following our [Getting Started](https://electrode-io.github.io/docs/quick_guide.html): Quick Start and Intermediate Guide. We start with our out-the-box Electrode App generator, create and publish an awesome standalone component and add a custom Hapi server plugin, routes and CSS modules.

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone your-forked-version-of-this app
$ npm install
```

Note: You will need to [generate a GitHup Api oAuth token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) to remove the preset limit for API requests. We have already added the code to accept and use the token in our Hapi server plugin above `const AUTH_TOKEN = process.env.token`.

Click [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) to set a new personal access token (you may be prompted to login to your GitHub account if you have not already). Create your own `token description` in the form given and for `Select scopes` simply check: `public repo`. Then hit the green `Generate token` button.

You will be redirected to the next page where your new token is. Keep your token private and secure; do not copy and paste it directly into your app. Instead, we will set your token as a Node [environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env).
Copy and save this token in a secure place; we will use it several times. Use this token in your command line as follows:

Set the token locally:

```bash
$ token='your-token-here' gulp dev
```

Navigate to your browser and run `localhost:3000` and have fun. Open this application in your favorite text editor to examine the code, personalize the application and add more [Electrode components](https://electrode-io.github.io/docs/create_reusable_component.html). You can view the Heroku deployed version of this [example app here](https://electrode-example-app.herokuapp.com/).
